Artist Data Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about 11 artists. The dataset includes the following fields for each artist:

Name and Surname: The full name of the artist.
Genre: The type of music the artist performs.
Release Year: The year when the artist released their debut.
Album Sales: The approximate number of album sales.
Objective
We will create a list of objects, each representing an artist from the table. Using this list, we will perform various queries to extract specific information based on the dataset.

Queries to Perform
Artists Whose Names Start with 'S': List all artists whose names begin with the letter 'S'.

Artists with Album Sales Over 10 Million: Identify artists who have sold more than 10 million albums.

Pop Artists Who Debuted Before 2000: List pop artists who released their debut before the year 2000. The list should be sorted alphabetically by the artist's name.

Artist with the Highest Album Sales: Find the artist with the highest album sales.

Most Recent and Oldest Debuting Artists: Identify the artist with the most recent debut and the one with the oldest debut.

Implementation
The solution involves creating a class to represent each artist and then populating a list with instances of this class based on the data provided in the table. We will then implement methods to execute each of the queries listed above.
